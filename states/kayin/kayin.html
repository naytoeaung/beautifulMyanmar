      <p id="txtone">The Karen are an ethnolinguistic group of Sino-Tibetan language-speaking peoples. The group as a whole is heterogeneous and disparate as many Karen ethnic groups do not associate or identify with each other culturally or linguistically. These Karen groups reside primarily in Kayin State, southern and southeastern Myanmar. The Karen, approximately five million people, account for approximately seven per cent of the Burmese population.</p>

      <p id="txttwo">Kayin Don Dance is famous as its traditional dance. The dance involves a line of men and a line of women moving in unison to accompanying music. They sing while dancing and music is played by Kayin traditional instruments. The event occur during the annual Kayin New Year celebration, which took place from December 31 to January 2. Huge number of ethnic Kayin and others flocked to the pagoda to witness the dance contest.</p>

      <p id="txtthree">Kayin Bamboo Dance is also a well known dance of Kayin People. It is similar to the Chin Bamboo Dance. A bamboo latticework is laid on the ground and people make quick steps in and out. It needs timing and the participants have to be skillful. We can see this dance at the ceremonies of the state and Kayin New Year festivals. The Karen bamboo dance is also quite well known and popular among other races in Myanmar.</p>

    <p id="second-txt">Kayin State provides the variety of a mountainous terrain amidst the beaches and seas of Southern Myanmar. The state is encircled by karst limestone peaks that soar above the lush green paddy fields. Interspersed with incredible caves, Kayin offers a stunning view of the western mountainous area of Myanmar. Hpa-An is the capital city of Kayin state. The city itself is beautiful, surrounded with limestone peaks on all sides. A typical Kayin landscape is characterized by lush green farms which make way to lush green mountains. Kayin is famous for its tea and coffee production.</p>

      <h4 id="topicone">Mount Zwegabin</h4>
      <p id="paraone">One of the travel destinations of Kayin state is the Mount Zwegabin, around 722 meters above sea level. It is the highest point in the region and you can see the view of the state. The terrain around the Zwegabin is flat to the north to west but hilly to the South East. For the few travellers who make it up there, a stay at the monastery on top of Mount Zwegabin (725m) is one of southeastern Myanmar’s highlights thanks to the stunning views back towards Hpa-an and the chance to spend a night in relative isolation. The area around Mount Zwegabin, is quite densely populated, with 155 inhabitants per square kilometer. The closest major city is Hpa-an, 8.2 km northwest of Mount Zwegabin. The surroundings around the mountains are a mosaic of agricultural land and natural vegetation.</p>

      <h4 id="topictwo">Saddan Cave</h4>
      <p id="paratwo">This football-stadium-sized cave is simply breathtaking, its entrance dominated by dozens of buddha statues, a couple of pagodas and some newer clay wall carvings. With the cave now illuminated, you can scramble for 15 or 20 minutes through chambers as high as a cathedral, past truck-sized stalactites and, in places, walls of crystal.As you emerge at the cave’s far side the wonders only increase: the burst of sunlight reveals a secret lake full of ducks and flowering lilies hidden in a bowl of craggy peaks. There's another cave on the far side of the lake that's actually half flooded, but local fishers occasionally paddle through it for 10 minutes to yet another lake. You may be able to persuade someone to take you along. Saddan Cave can be traversed only partially during the rainy season. Come during the dry season (around November to April) for the full experience.</p>

    <div id="notethree">
      <h4 id="topicthree">Kyauk Kalat Pagoda</h4>
      <p id="parathree">Hpa-an’s Kyauk Kalat Pagoda is a stunning stupa-topped limestone pinnacle, set on a tiny isle dotted with monastic buildings itself set in a lake fluttering with white egrets and surrounded by paddy. With Mount Zwegabin as the dramatic backdrop, it’s a gorgeous sight. In fact while not (yet) as well-known among tourists as for instance Shwedagon, Mount Popa, U Bein Bridge or the Golden Rock, Kyauk Kalat would certainly merit a position on any list of Burma’s most iconic sites. The island is reached by a wooden footbridge and visitors are permitted to reach as high as a shrine halfway up the outcrop. While you are free to wander anywhere else, it is an active monastery and meditation site, so leave your footwear at the end of the bridge and please behave quietly and respectfully.</p>

      <h4 id="topicfour">Hpa-an</h4>
      <p id="parafour">Though Hpa-an is officially the capital of Kayin (or Karen) State, it has the distinct feel of a country town. With the completion in early 2016 of a new highway linking Hpa-an to the Thai border at Mae Sot and Yangon plus the improved border crossing facilities at Myawaddy, things are changing rapidly. Traditionally a market centre and transport hub for the surrounding region, these days well-heeled local visitors from farther north are profiting from its new accessibility as Thais flock over the border on their holiday weekends. As a convenient land crossing between Thailand and Burma, Khao San Road and Chiang Mai tour agents now offer ‘direct’ tickets to Yangon, passing through Myawaddy and Hpa-an, and many of the more adventurous seem to be breaking up the journey with a stop in this picturesque region.</p>
