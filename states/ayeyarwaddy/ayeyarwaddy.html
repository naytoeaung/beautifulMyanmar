      <p id="txtone">Myanmar’s majority group (around 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population), the Bamar have traditionally held sway over much of the country, particularly the fertile central plains and Ayeyarwady valley. Originally migrants from the southern China, the Bamar (or “Burmans”, as they were known in colonial times) were a wet-rice farming people, Theravada Buddhist by religion, whose tonal, Tibeto-Burman tongue – Burmese – has long been the national language.</p>

      <p id="txttwo">All-night performances, which combine melodrama, slapstick, traditional dance, and even pop music are called "zat pwe" in Burma. These seasonal events are staged in enclosed temporary bamboo theaters and are typically part of annual fund raising activities at pagoda festivals. The performers are traveling troupes, usually several dozen professional male and female dancers, musicians, comedians, and actors. These troupes travel widely throughout the country.</p>

      <p id="txtthree">Traditional music from Burma is melodious, generally without harmony, and usually in 4/4 time (na-yi-se) or 2/4 (wa-let-se) or 8/16 (wa-let-a-myan). There are "the segments combined into patterns, combined into verses, combined into songs [that] make Burmese music a multileveled hierarchical system...The Burmese musician manipulates the various levels of the hierarchy to create the song..."</p>

    <h2 id="second-head">AYEYARWADDY</h2>
    <p id="second-txt">Thriving with dense greenery and wildlife, Ayeyarwady serves as the ideal getaway for those who love to explore the beauty of nature. The journey to the region from Yangon takes about 2 hours. Tourists crowd this place for a session of relaxation by the calm and peaceful environment of Ayeyarwady. The locals also love visiting the beaches during the weekends as they are not too far from the surrounding regions and states. The picturesque view of the beaches that showcases crystal clear water under the bright blue sky prompts tourists to go for a refreshing swim. The region is rich with culture and traditions of tribes that reside in that area. Ayeyarwady also offers tons of fun adventures and activities like sailing, elephant observations and visiting pagodas.</p>

      <h4 id="topicone">Chaung Tha Beach</h4>
      <p id="paraone">Of the three main beach resorts on Myanmar’s Bay of Bengal coast, Chaung Tha is the most down to earth, and you can find the largest number of locals on holiday here. The beach lacks the white-sand perfection of Ngapali and Ngwe Saung, but it has several offshore islands to explore and snorkel around, and offers the same delicious range of fresh seafood as its more exclusive rivals (Chaung Tha is the same distance from Yangon by road as Ngwe Saung, and you can travel between the two beaches by motorbike along a coastal track). Chaung Tha's main beach may be scrappy, but it is fun, particularly when it is full of locals on a weekend away from Yangon - popular times of year include new year, the Thingyan water festival and the end of the Myanmar school summer holidays in May. </p>

      <h4 id="topictwo">Ngwe Saung Beach</h4>
      <p id="paratwo">A sleepy fishing village with hotels spread along its beautiful white sand shore, Ngwe Saung (pronounced ‘nway saung’) is a perfect place to relax after a few weeks’ travelling around Myanmar. One of the most laid-back places you will find in the country, the real joy here is to sit back and take in the sun’s rays and picturesque beach views, or try the catch of the day in a local restaurant. The beach stretches for several kilometres and Ngwe Saung village can be found towards the northern end; it has a host of places that serve a variety of fantastic seafood dishes, including crab, shrimp, lobster, and various types of fish, as well as shops selling locally-produced handicrafts. The walk to the village from some of the hotels at the southern end of the main beach can take up to an hour – although it is worth it not only for the food, but also to catch the sun setting over the Bay of Bengal.</p>

      <h4 id="topicthree">Goyangyi island</h4>
      <p id="parathree">Even It's still difficult to reach there , It's really beautiful Island and it becomes a tourist destination due to its beautiful rock formation and reefs. It's also beautiful two-sided beaches when you are in there! Every can go directly to Gaw Yin Gyi Island by own private car that it takes 6 to 8 hours from Ngwe Saung Beach. Road from Ngwe Saung Beach to Maw Tin Sun Junction is even narrow , it's OK to drive , then Keep drive to Nga Yoke Kaung ( Taung ) junction & then proceed to Gaw Yin Gyi Island for over 28 miles. On the way to Gaw Yin Gyi Island , there are two Elephant Camps where you can have Elephant Riding , bathing & Feeding. Myawaddy Pagoda on the top of Gaw Yin Gyi Island is the best view point to see the Sea and surrounding area! It's over 400 steps to climb up to the top. Highly recommend to stay overnight at Gaw Yin Gyi Island!!!</p>

      <h4 id="topicfour">Lovers island</h4>
      <p id="parafour">Myanmar holds many beautiful spots which no one knows that make those places remain the unspoiled traits and landscapes. Among them, one cannot be missed in your Myanmar vacation is Lover’s Island – a sleeping islet, a small hummock on the coast of Ayeyarwady Region’s Ngwe Saung Beach that would not disappoint you. According to the locals, the name Lover’s Island is based on the mythology of star-crossed lovers expatriated from the mainland only to show off their affection among the lush foliage 500 meters from shore. However, Lover’s Island is actually a name given for foreigners since foreign couples often visit this place to have a private space. Although the name of this island does not tell the truth of any historical or biological facts, it is a splendid and charming destination in southern Myanmar for Ngwe Saung visitors. When the tide is out, parts of Bengal Bay reveals a passageway of sea-floor to Lover’s Island. </p>

      <h4 id="topicadd">Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary</h4>
      <p id="paraadd">Bogale (pronounced ‘Bow-ga-lay’ and sometimes spelt Bogalay) is a city and administrative centre south west of Yangon, located deep in the Irrawaddy Delta. It is a lively port town and provides the chance to see how different delta life is to the hustle and bustle of Yangon; the Strand Road and the market are worth a stroll. With relatively little to do in the town itself, Bogale is perhaps best visited as a transit point on the way to the nearby Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary, where you can see migratory waterbirds; saltwater crocodiles (the largest reptiles on the planet); and, if you are lucky, the rare Irrawaddy dolphin. No permit is necessary to visit Bogale or Meinmahla Kyun Wildlife Sanctuary, but you are required to register at the Sanctuary Headquarters in Bogale before going there; this is located in the Forest Department compound towards the northern end of the Strand Road.</p>

The texture of the salad was unique, a adoring combination of soft, crunchy, crispy, and saucy. I could eat this salad constantly for days.</p>
