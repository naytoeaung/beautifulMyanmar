      <p id="paraone">Indawgyi Lake is a secluded destination for nature lovers in remote Kachin State. The largest lake in Myanmar, Indawgyi remains pristine and undeveloped and has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve; it’s still possible to find places where you won’t hear the drone of a motor – or even see a single boat. The area is largely untouched by tourism, with few foreigners making the journey this far north. It’s truly a place to relax and enjoy the simple rural lifestyle and the beautiful natural surroundings. Indawgyi has also become something of an adventure destination with kayaking, trekking, cycling and recreational fishing all on offer. </p>

      <p id="paratwo">The Irrawaddy or, officially, Ayeyarwady River is a river that flows from north to south through Myanmar. It is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. Originating from the confluence of the N'mai and Mali rivers, it flows relatively straight North-South before emptying through the Irrawaddy Delta into the Andaman Sea. Its drainage basin of about 404,200 square kilometres covers a large part of Burma. After Rudyard Kipling's poem, it is sometimes referred to as 'The Road to Mandalay'. As early as the sixth century, the river was used for trade and transport. Having developed an extensive network of irrigation canals, the river became important to the British Empire after it had colonized Burma. The river is still as vital today, as a considerable amount of goods and traffic moves by river. Rice is produced in the Irrawaddy Delta, irrigated by water from the river. </p>
